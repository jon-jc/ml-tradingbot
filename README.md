# TraderBot: Sentiment-Based Algorithmic Trading System

Welcome to TraderBot, a machine learning-driven trading bot that uses live news sentiment to influence trading decisions. Below is the complete setup guide, including the use of a `.env` file for securely managing environment variables.

## Environment Setup

### 1. Virtual Environment
Create and activate a virtual environment to manage dependencies:
```sh
conda create -n trader python=3.10
conda activate trader
```

### 2. Dependency Installation
Install the necessary Python packages:
```sh
pip install lumibot timedelta alpaca-trade-api==3.1.1
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio transformers
pip install python-dotenv
```

### 3. Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in your project root directory and add your API keys and other sensitive settings:
```plaintext
API_KEY=your_alpaca_api_key_here
API_SECRET=your_alpaca_api_secret_here
```

### 4. SSL Configuration
Download and install required SSL certificates if you encounter SSL errors:
```sh
# Example commands to download and install certificates
wget https://letsencrypt.org/certs/lets-encrypt-r3.pem
# Convert to .cer and install as per your operating system requirements
```

## Running the Bot
Load environment variables and run the trading bot:
```sh
python -m dotenv run -- python tradingbot.py
```

## Technologies and Architecture
TraderBot uses Python, Conda, PyTorch, Transformers, and Alpaca API, incorporating the python-dotenv package for environment management.
